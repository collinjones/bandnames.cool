        <h3 class="faq-text">Q: What is this site?</h3>
        <p class="faq-text">A: bandnames.cool is a band name aggregate website. 
            We love cool band names. This website was created by a bunch of boys who loved 
            keeping lists of cool band names they thought of. This website was created to 
            help people like us share their collections of cool band names!  </p>
        
        <h3 class="faq-text">Q: What are band names? </h3>
        <p class="faq-text">A: Great question. We don't know. Band names can be whatever you want them to 
            be. Don't let your definition of band names be limited to the bands you know! 
            Think of the band names YOU want to see in the world (unless you see someone 
            upload a string of random characters or somethingâ€¦ in that case, DOWNVOTE THEM 
            INTO OBLIVION!!!) </p>
        
        <h3 class="faq-text">Q: How can I submit band names?</h3>
        <p class="faq-text">A: You can submit one band name at the top of the webpage by pressing "submit". 
            You can submit MANY band names at once using the "Batch Submit" option, which 
            accepts several different list formats! You do NOT need to sign up to submit band names. </p>

        <h3 class="faq-text">Q: What's the wheel for?</h3>
        <p class="faq-text">A: Spin the wheel with your cursor (or touchscreen on mobile devices) and 
            find out! Discover new band names and give them upvotes or downvotes. You 
            can also spin and stop the wheel with the "Spin Wheel" and "Stop Wheel" 
            buttons respectively. Band names on the wheel refresh with every up/downvote. </p>

        <h3 class="faq-text">Q: Why can't I upvote/downvote band names?</h3>
        <p class="faq-text">A: Currently, we require users to <a href="{% url 'registration' %}">sign up</a> for an account to upvote/downvote different 
            band names. This may change eventually! </p>

        <h3 class="faq-text">Q: Why are all the names I'm seeing censored? </h3>
        <p class="faq-text">A: A sitewide profanity filter is enabled by default. To turn off the profanity filter, 
            please <a href="{% url 'registration' %}">sign up</a> for an account and then navigate to the "Profile" button at the top of the 
            webpage, uncheck the "Profanity Filter" box, and press "Submit" to uncensor the bad words! </p>

        <h3 class="faq-text">Q: Can I see the band names I've uploaded? </h3>
        <p class="faq-text">A: Yes, you can! Currently, the only way to view the band names you've uploaded is to <a href="{% url 'registration' %}">sign up</a>
            for an account - you can then view your submitted band names in the "Profile" tab from 
            best-to-worst ranked.</p>

        <h3 class="faq-text">Q: Can I use a band name I found on this site?</h3>
        <p class="faq-text">A: As long as someone else isn't using it already! We claim no band name uploaded to this website as our own. Anything uploaded is 
            fair game, so long as it isn't a band that already exists. </p>

        <h3 class="faq-text">Q: How can I report bugs or submit feedback?</h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
            A: Please report any bugs you come across and submit any feedback you have to this email: <a href = "mailto: coolbandnames@bandnames.cool">coolbandnames@bandnames.cool</a>
        </p>
